"""State inspection and maintenance helpers (public facade).

The public surface (the ``State*`` dataclasses and
:class:`StateMaintenanceService`) is preserved here. The implementation lives
in the focused submodules (``_state_models`` / ``_state_aggregates`` /
``_state_doctor`` / ``_state_prune``); this file re-imports those helpers and
keeps :class:`StateMaintenanceService` so external imports keep working
unchanged.
